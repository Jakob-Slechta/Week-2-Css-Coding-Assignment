    <i>A very sweet smile to contrast that she could punch out anything.</i>
    <br>
    <p>Blazblue's Bullet, she's mostly a side character in the grand scheme of things but she's very likeable.
        A young orphan girl raised by mercanaries, the only thing she really understands is combat. So she's almost always 
        having her guard up, there's never really a moment of rest in her eyes. She's downright anti-social as a result of always
        being in combat mood, which pushes others away from her. Little do they know, she's as kind as a person can come.

        <li><b>Skills:</b>Incredible Strength, A Great Amount of Skill in Battle.</li>

    <i>Note: Bullet sadly didn't have likes or dislikes displayed anywhere.</i>
    <br>
    <p><b>In Conclusion:</b> Bullet is another very fine character in the very strange series that is Blazblue.
    I don't think anyone could really hate her, sure she obviously has zero social skills, but her heart is in the right place.
    That's all that really matters at the end of the day.</p>
