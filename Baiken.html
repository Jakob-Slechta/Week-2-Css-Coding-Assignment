    <i>A part of me still wonders how she gets such wild looking cow-licks for hair. What's her secret?</i>
    <br>
    <p> The series of Guilty Gear in short is a post-apocalypse that features plenty of magic, but it also features creatures known as gears.
        Baiken was unfortunate enough on one night when she was young to have her parents killed in front of her by gears, she herself lost an arm
        and an eye in the process. She went down a path of revenge for a good long time before eventually finding peace.
        She's mellowed out a bit, a good hearted person who will do what's right, but of course...She still has quite the temper. She's still very incredible.

    <i>"Whether or not a woman is perfumed, whether her hair is perfectly in place or goin' every which way, a man can always see true beauty. And you are one fine lady."</i> <b> - Johnny upon seeing Baiken</b>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Likes:</b>Sake, Drinking.</li>
        <li><b>Dislikes:</b>Tanuki Statues.</li>
        <li><b>Skills:</b> A Master with the Sword, Herculean Strength.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><b>In Conclusion:</b>Baiken is a great character, someone who's had a real full journey where she had to learn to let go of her anger.
    Her hair trigger temper is definitely something that might scare most people, but her dedication to do what's right is to be admired.
Plus you'd get to have someone who'd always beat you in drinking contests.</p>
