    <i>She can rock some seriously nice fashion when she wants to.</i>
    <p>Street Fighter is a series well known for having martial artists of many different backgrounds and from many different countries.
        Laura is a Brazilian woman who is outright said to be a near prodigy in Brazillian Jiu Jitsu, having been able to fling her father through a wall
        even when she was rather young at ten years old. She's upbeat, kind and as energetic as someone could imagine. She's also rather determined to
        promote her family's martial arts dojo. I don't know why she can shoot electricity, that remains a mystery, but she is very clearly an amazing woman.

    <br>
    <i>A big meat eater, I can relate.</i>
    <br>

    <ul class="center">
        <li><b>Likes:</b> Meat Dishes, Fighting, Fighting strong opponents, Tournaments, Relaxing on Beaches.</li>
        <li><b>Dislikes:</b> Vegetables, Boredom, Weak Men.</li>
        <li><b>Skills:</b> Electricity, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><b>In Conclusion:</b> Laura is clearly a dream woman for a lot of people for many reasons.
    She seems like the type someone could be around and never get bored, always feel supported and even safe.
    That's a special feeling someone can give.
